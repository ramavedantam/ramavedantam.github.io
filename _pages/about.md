I serve as Senior Director at [Flagship Pioneering](https://www.flagshippioneering.com/), where I lead AI efforts to create and scale new ventures. 

My research interests include: (1) foundational principles for building AI systems, including multimodality, safety, and reasoning; (2) making AI systems more humanlike and affective, with empathy and strong theory of mind; and (3) the science and art of system-level, recursive (or agentic) self-improvement.

Previously, I was a researcher with [Facebook AI Research (FAIR)](https://ai.meta.com/research/), Meta AI in NYC and also did stint as a visiting faculty member at the New York University [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/) (CDS). In a past life, I was a PhD student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.ic.gatech.edu/), where I was a [Google Ph.D. fellow](https://research.google/blog/announcing-the-2018-google-phd-fellows-for-north-america-europe-and-the-middle-east/).

I am grateful to many wonderful [collaborators](/people/) who have supported my work over the years.
