I am an AI researcher based out of New York.

Professionally, I have spent time at [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.meta.com/research/) (FAIR), Meta AI and at the New York University [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/) (CDS).

I earned my Ph.D. from [Georgia Tech](https://www.ic.gatech.edu/), where I was a [Google Ph.D. fellow](https://research.google/blog/announcing-the-2018-google-phd-fellows-for-north-america-europe-and-the-middle-east/).

I am grateful to my wonderful [collaborators](/people/) for their support.

News: I am on the academic job market! Please find my [research statement]({{  site.url }}/assets/pdf/rama_research_statement.pdf) and [teaching statement]({{  site.url }}/assets/pdf/rama_teaching_statement.pdf).
